    "# 14.2 Recursive algorithm: Search\n",
    "Consider a guessing game program where a friend thinks of a number from 0-100 and you try to guess the number, with the friend telling you to guess higher or lower until you guess correctly. What algorithm would you use to minimize the number of guesses? An algorithm that simply guesses in increments of 1 -- Is it 0? Is it 1? Is it 2? -- requires too many guesses (50 on average). An algorithm that guesses by 10s and then by 1s -- Is it 10? Higher: Is it 20? Higher: Is it 30? Lower: Is it 21? 22? 23? -- does better but still requires about 10 guesses on average (5 to find the correct tens digit and 5 to guess the correct ones digit). An even better algorithm uses a binary search approach, guessing the midpoint of the range and halving the range after each guess -- Is it 50 (the middle of 0-100)? Lower: Is it 25 (the middle of 0-50)? Higher: Is it 38 (the middle of 26-50)? Lower: Is it 32 (the middle of 26-38). After each guess, the binary search algorithm is applied again, just on a smaller range, i.e., the algorithm is recursive. "

    "Recursive functions can be particularly challenging to debug. Adding output statements can be helpful. Furthermore, an additional trick is to indent the print statements to show the current depth of recursion. The following program adds a parameter indent to a find() function that searches a sorted list for an item. All of the find() function's print statements start with \"print indent, ...\". The indent variable is typically some number of spaces. The script sets indent to three spaces \" \". Each recursive call adds three more spaces.
